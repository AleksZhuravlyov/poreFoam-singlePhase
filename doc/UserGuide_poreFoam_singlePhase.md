Summary   
========

This document presents the details of the poreFoam codes and scripts and
the instructions for using them to run single-phase flow simulations on
micro-CT images of porous media. The poreFoam package consists of
pre-processing, processing and and post-processing applications, which
includes standard C++ codes as well as applications written using
OpenFOAM. To simplify and automate the preprocessing, processing and
post-processing stages, Conventions on the file names has been set and
bash scripts are developed for the simulation set up. This document
presents a description of the keywords, file-name conventions and the
scripts used to do direct single-phase flow simulations.

 
Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

You should have official OpenFOAM (version 1612+ in this document:
<https://www.openfoam.com/releases/openfoam-v1612+>) installed in your
Linux machine. Paraview should be installed for visualization,
preferably through system provided packages.

Downloading and extracting files
--------------------------------

Create a directory in your home (`~`) folder named "works" and
extract/download the codes inside it in a folder named apps. You can
choose any other folder and the scripts will work, but this ducument
assumes you install the codes in "`~/works/apps`" folder.

To check that the directories are created correctly, type in a terminal
:

```  {.bash language="bash"}
#  Important: replace ~/works/apps with the 
#  directory in which you have extracted the codes 
ls   ~/works/apps/scripts   ~/works/apps/poreFoam* ~/works/apps/voxelImage
``` 

and it should not show the error message "`No such file or directory`".

Compiling the codes
-------------------

Edit the "`~/works/apps/poreFoam/bashrc`" file making sure it sources
the OpenFOAM-1612+/etc/bashrc file based on your OpenFOAM installation
directories.

The mesh generation code (rawToFoamPar) in requires a recent C++
compiler, you can set it either in the `voxelImage/Makefile` or by
setting the variable `CXX` in file `~/works/apps/bashrc`. The default
(g++) may work and hence you don't need to do any change.

Then open a terminal and type the following commands to compile the
codes:

```  {.bash language="bash"}
(cd ~/works/apps/poreFoam && ./AllMake) 
``` 

Setting the Environmental variables:
------------------------------------

Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file (optional but
recomended),

```  {.bash language="bash"}
source ~/works/apps/bashrc
``` 

This makes the poreFoam scripts available in any new terminal you open.

Usage
=====

Input file format
-----------------

The required input files are:

1.  Input header file.

2.  Micro-CT images should be given in ascii (suffix should be `.dat`)
    or binary files (better to have `.raw` suffix, the data should be in
    8bit unsigned char). Compressed raw images are supported, for which
    the file suffix should be `.raw.gz`. You can use ImageJ, or the
    imageFileConvert from the voxelImage library to convert between
    image types.

The input header file for the flow simulation codes is a .mhd header
file, which is a standard format compatible with Paraview and Fiji
(ImageJ with plugins), with additional optional image manipulation
commands specific to poreFoam package (and my other codes --
image-processing, two-phase flow, network modelling codes etc.).

The main keywords of the .mhd header are as follows. (First to third
keywords should not be changed):

1.  `ObjectType =  Image`

2.  `NDims =       3`

3.  `ElementType = MET_UCHAR`

4.  keyword: `DimSize` -- used to assign the dimensions of the image:
    Nx, Ny and Nz

5.  keyword: `ElementSpacing` -- used for assigning voxel size:
    $\delta x$, $\delta y$ and $\delta z$ should be equal

6.  keyword: `ElementDataFile` -- specifies the name of binary 8bit data
    file (.raw), ascii (.dat) files are supported too, but only by the
    poreFoam codes. For compressed images, the file suffix should be
    .raw.gz.

 

                        ObjectType =  Image
                        NDims =       3
                        ElementType = MET_UCHAR

                        DimSize =        400    400    400
                        ElementSpacing = 5.345  5.345  5.345  
                        Offset =         0       0       0

                        ElementDataFile = Berea.raw

                        ####optional keywords, uncomment to activate:
                        #BinaryData = True  
                        #threshold  0 0   # void space range in the image 
                        #direction  z       # turn image in y or z direction 
                        #cropD       0 0 0 200 200 200   # crop the image 
                        #resample   2   # coarsen (>1) or refine (<1), not tested 

Â 

Notes:

1.  The order of the first 7 keywords should not be changed for
    compatibility with third-party software (ImageJ and Paraview). The
    rest of the keywords are optional.

2.  "`#`" is used for comments

3.  All keyword and its data should be given in a single line

For more advanced features you can edit the scripts in the
`~/works/apps/scripts/SP` folder, other input parameters which are not
handled through the scripts can be edited manually by editing the files
in `~/works/apps/scripts/singlePhase/base` folder that follows, more or
less, the OpenFOAM input file format conventions.

Running simulations
-------------------

Sample input file is provided in docs/Berea.mhd, which is a ascii header
file for the Berea image (from 2009) available on Imperial college
pore-scale modelling website:
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/perm/research/pore-scale-modelling/micro-ct-images-and-networks>.

To run a single-phase flow simulation on a micro-CT image, first the
header file should be prepared as discussed in the previous section,
then they should be copied in a directory where there is enough disk
space; the 3D simulation results take disk-spaces on the order of
Gigabytes, depending on the size of the image . Then in this directory
run one of the following commands:

```  {.bash language="bash"}

    # 1. Set the Environmental variables if you have not done so far:
    #   First, you have to add the scripts for single-phase 
    #   flow calculation to the system path. To do so, type:
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/works/apps/scripts/singlePhase
    export nProcX=2  # optional
    export nProcY=2  # optional
    export nProcZ=3  # optional
    # 2. Running the single-phase flow solver,

    # to get help for how to run the scripts, type:
    AllRunImagePar -h 

    # to run on image XXX.mhd in serial mode, type:
    AllRunImage XXX.mhd
    # or to run on all .raw files in the current directory in serial mode:
    AllRunImage
    #  or to run on XXX.raw file in parallel mode on a single machine:
    AllRunImagePar XXX.mhd
    #  or to run on all .mhd files in parallel on a single machine  
    AllRunImagePar
    #  or parallel mode on a distributed cluster, edit $PoreScaleDir/scripts/singlePhase/machines.txt first and type:  
    AllRunImageParDistributed XXX.mhd
``` 

The same approach can be used to run the simulation on ascii files,
provided that you have .dat as the file suffix (e.g. XXX.dat); of course
you should replace "XXX.raw" to the name of ascii file, XXX.dat, or set
the keyword BinaryData to False.

Simulation results and visualization
------------------------------------

After running the simulation scrips the results will be saved in a
subdirectory inside a directory with the same name as the micro-CT image
(without the suffix), which includes the log files of individual
applications, openfoam simulation results and the pressure and velocity
fields converted into raw files, in either ascii (.dat) or binary (.raw)
format: To change the default behavior, you have to open the script
files AllRunImage/AllRunImagePar (located in folder
`$PoreScaleDir/scripts/singlePhase/`) and change

"`: ${outPutFormat:=binary}`" to "`: ${outPutFormat:=ascii}`" or
"`: ${outPutFormat:=oldBinary}`" or "`: ${outPutFormat:=oldBinary}`".

In binary format, the velocity and pressure fields are written in
small-endian 32bit floating-point numbers. When oldAscii/oldBinary
format is chosen the velocity files will have the same size as the
original image, but otherwise the (default) Ufx, Ufy and Ufz files will
have one additional layers in x, y and z directions respectively (to
match the number of faces between all pairs of neighbouring voxels).
They can be opened in image-processing software like Avizo and ImageJ. A
helper file is written with these files named "`OpenMeInParaview.xmf`"
which can be used to load the .raw velocity and pressure files in
Paraview or other software supporting .xmf format.

The openfoam simulation parameters and results are saved inside a folder
called openfoam "case", which includes subdirectories named "constant"
and "system" and in many other "time" directories which have
floating-point numbers as their names such as "0" or "0.1", \... . To
visualize the openfoam files, you can use Paraview and open the
system/controlDict file. The permeability and effective (connected)
porosity are reported in a file with prefix `summary_` in the case
folder. Velocity distribution and formation factors are also computed
and written into the same file.

The single-phase flow solver is derived from the two-phase direct
simulation code discussed in the paper:

    Two-Phase Flow in Porous Media at the Pore Scale Using the

    5653-5668 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2012.04.011>

Essentially the main difference with the openfoam-provided codes is the
treatment of the no-slip boundary condition for improving the accuracy
of permeability prediction. The details of the pre/post-processing tools
are not documented, but you can have a look at the source code or send
an email (see below) if you want to know more.

Overview the applications used in the scripts
=============================================

***OpenFOAM utilities:***

renumberMesh:

:   renumbers mesh to improve performance (optional)

redistributePar:

:   using scotch to redistribute mesh between processors (optional)

***Solvers and utilities not available in OpenFOAM:***

rawToFoam(Par):

:   converts raw file to OpenFOAM format, used for single-phase flow
    simulation. It also does simple image processing tasks like cropping
    and thresholding. It also lable the disconnected parts of the image
    and only keeps the largest connected pathway (to avoid linear solver
    crash). A parallel version of this code is developed but not yet
    integrated into the poreFoam package (to avoid complexity in
    compilations), please drop me an email if the gain in computational
    speed is important for you.

iInterFoam101SP:

:   single-phase flow solver, trimmed version of the two-phase flow
    solver, the main differences with the OpenFOAM single-phase flow
    solvers is the implementation of the boundary conditions and the
    pressure-velocity coupling.

iPotentialFoam:

:   used for initialization of pressure and velocity for improving the
    convergence of simulations (effective when the Reynold number is low
    and the image is a typical micro-CT image of a porous rock).

calc\_distributions:

:   post-processing, calculates effective porosity and permeability,
    formation factor and velocity distributions.

FOAM2Voxel:

:   post-processing, converts Openfoam simulation results into .dat/.raw
    files.

***Additional useful utilities:***

Ufraw2Uc:

:   converts face-centred Uf\*.raw files into cell-centred velocities
    file, useful for importing velocities in Avizo \...

voxelImageConvert:

:   converts between image formats, applies cropping, resampling etc,
    supports basic data types other than unsigned char (default); see
    .mhd header file specifications: see
    <https://itk.org/Wiki/ITK/MetaIO/Documentation> for more details.

Using zlib  
==========

The voxelImage library can read from .gz compressed raw binary files
directly, and write .gz compressed files directly if zlib is installed,
in a folder named thirdparty. i.e. "`apps/thirdparty/zlib-1.2.11`". The
zlib package can be downloaded from <http://zlib.net/>. Once zlib is
installed, you can activate it by adding (uncommenting) the following
entries to the file `voxelImage/Makefile`:

```  {.bash language="bash"}
ZLIBDIR=../thirdparty/zlib-1.2.11/
ZLIBFLAGS=-DZLIB -I$(ZLIBDIR) -I$(ZLIBDIR)/contrib/iostream3/
ZLINKFLAGS=zfstream.o -L$(ZLIBDIR) -lz
zstreamo=zfstream.o
``` 

Note: zlib support is experimental at this stage, further integration
and testing is needed.
