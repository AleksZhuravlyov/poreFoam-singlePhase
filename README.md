# poreFoam/singlePhase

___


### PoreFoam codes for simulating direct single-phase flow (solving incompressible Naview-Stokes equations) on 3D images of porous media using OpenFOAM

---

### Prerequisites: 

- OpenFOAM-v1612+
- zlib-1.2.11 (optional)
- voxelImage library (included)


---

### Instructions

- Please see the doc folder for [installation and usage](https://github.com/aliraeini/poreFoam-singlePhase/blob/master/doc/UserGuide_poreFoam_singlePhase.md),  and a sample input file -- [Berea.mhd](https://github.com/aliraeini/poreFoam-singlePhase/blob/master/doc/Berea.mhd) -- for the [Berea.raw image](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/perm/research/pore-scale-modelling/micro-ct-images-and-networks/berea-sandstone/)

- If you do not have an openfoam installed on your computer, you can check out the branch [pore+miniFoamLibZTif](https://github.com/aliraeini/poreFoam-singlePhase/tree/pore+miniFoamLibZTif) which does not need a separate openfoam installation.
